# Random-Programs
It contains a series of self- made programs that I especially like.

#1  floyd_pattern ->    this program is based on floyd pattern.

#2  Magic_root  ->      this programs computes the square root of any number without using any inbuilt library or root method, 
                        example-sqrt(),etc.

#3  nQuuens ->          this program computes nQueens problems though readability is quite less, 
                         it computes the best way in which you can place N number of Queens on a (N*N) chess board.
    
#4  pattern_name  ->    this program is a special one.Enter any String and it will show the input string in form of a pattern,
                        Unlike the traditional methods this program is special. 
                        
More to come....
